# Project Overview

## Description
Welcome to our exciting project, where we've combined the power of Android development with the robustness of Spring Boot to create an innovative meme browsing and storing experience. This project showcases a seamless integration of technologies, including advanced concepts like RxJava for reactive programming and dependency injection with Dagger Hilt. On the backend, we've implemented Spring Security for user-based authentication and adopted the MVVM architecture pattern for both the Android app and the Spring Boot API.

## Features
Our project boasts an array of features designed to deliver an engaging user experience:
- **Android Application**: An intuitive app interface for browsing and storing memes, built using modern Android development practices.
- **Spring Boot API**: A robust backend API powered by Spring Boot, offering seamless meme storage and retrieval functionalities.
- **RxJava Integration**: Leveraging RxJava for reactive programming in the Android app, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.
- **Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt**: Utilizing Dagger Hilt for dependency injection in the Android app, promoting modularization and maintainability.
- **Spring Security Implementation**: Ensuring secure user authentication with Spring Security on the backend, safeguarding user data and privacy.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Following the MVVM architecture pattern in both the Android app and the Spring Boot API, facilitating clean separation of concerns and easier testing.

## Technologies Used
Our project harnesses the power of several cutting-edge technologies:
- **Android**: Android development platform for creating the user-facing application.
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building Java-based backend applications.
- **Spring Security**: A comprehensive security solution for securing Spring-based applications.
- **RxJava**: A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences.
- **Dagger Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android that reduces boilerplate code and promotes code reusability.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A software architectural pattern that facilitates separation of concerns and enhances testability.
